# Elm Checkout

Just for fun, I thought I'd test my Elm abilities by attempting one of the homework exercises we set junior Scala candidates ahead of their job interview.

We always say that candidates ought to spend two hours on it and stop - hopefully they've finished - no big deal if they haven't. Quality over quantity. The idea is to be fair to people with less time on their hands, such as parents like myself. I have to say... I spent significantly more than two hours doing this, and I knew how to solve the problem! In fairness, mostly I was trying to work out how to do things in Elm, there were more gaps in my knowledge (...and the standard library...) than I realised!

On the plus side I know a lot more now...

I created the solution TDD style (unusual for me) and quickly added the UI at the end. Very pleased I wrote the tests as Elm has a few hiccups I would have been pulling my hair out debugging otherwise.
